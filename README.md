# Modeling-of-fluctuations
Repository for our team`s project

Task is to create a visualisation of fluctuations, basing on the start-up conditions.

Input consists of several variables:

    x0 - length of pendulum
    k - asperity of spring
    A - amplitude of motor fluctuations
    alpha0 - the start-up angle
    v0 - initial speed of body along the rod
    w0 - initial angular speed of body
    A4 - coefficient at t^4
    B - coefficient at t^3
    C - coefficient at t^2
    D - coefficient at t
    E - free member

fi is function of time. fi specifies phase change of motor. fi is polynomial of degree 4. fi = A_4t^4 + Bt^3 + Ct^2 + Dt + E Spring is unloaded in t = 0.
