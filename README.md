# Modeling-of-fluctuations
Repository for our team`s project

Task is to create a visualisation of fluctuations, basing on the start-up conditions.

Input consists of several variables: 
1) l0 - length of pendulum
2) k - asperity of spring
3) fi - function of time
4) A - amplitude of motor fluctuations
5) alpha0 - the start-up angle

Spring is unloaded in t = 0.
